# Elementary-Arch
Make Arch Gnome look like Elementary OS 

- Once the program is done running in the terminal, (aka. the terminal stops with this as it's last line: `Terminal=false`)
Just press CTRL+D and close the terminal

Now everything is done! To activate the changes, just open up gnome-tweak-tool and set your shell theme and gtk theme to MacOS-Sierra with your icon theme being La-capitaine-icon-theme. Then, just search for 'Panther' and add it to your dock.

# Enjoy!

NOTE: To download and install, just copy this line into your terminal:
- `git clone https://github.com/keeganmilsten/Elementary-Arch`

Next, execute the install.sh file inside Elementary-Arch and wait for it to do the work for you.
